This component was taken ( slightlyadapted) from 
Hlidskailf's Mod Resurrections; Improved Brown 
Dragon v1.3.

(For some reason, this was lost from BPv160 to 
present date (v176)--it was originally in BP-classic
as well.)



The Brown Dragon in the Druid Grove (Hard Difficulty)

After you have killed the evil Faldorn a new menace moves into the area,
the Brown Dragon. It must be defeated, but it is a tough fight! It has 
some custom items I made that use in game descriptions, so I had no need 
to modify dialog tlk. Both of the figurines found on the Brown Dragon 
summon custom cres, that run their own scripts which makes them protect 
player1 and move around some for more life like behavior. 

Files Included: KRDRGBRN.cre, KRDRGBRN.bcs, Spell.ids, SPIN396.spl, 
KRMISC01.itm, KRMISC02.itm, KRLIOSU.cre, KRAIRSU2.cre, KRSUMMON.bcs, 
AR1900.bcs (modified to put the dragon there). DRAGRED3.itm

Location in Game: Druid Grove, in a Chapter after 2, when Faldorn is Dead.

*Note: This is this version is the Extremely Hard version of the Dragon,
It does insane damage on each hit and lots of damage with its breath weapon. 
For those who are extremely high level and want a challenge.* I will release 
another version of this Dragon, for normal parties, soon.

Any problems, comments, questions, etc, can be sent to Kensai Ryu at 
AstroBouncer@Aol.com.

Hope you enjoy. More coming soon!

v1.3 replaces the brown dragon's script with a better copy of the original made by Kensai Ryu.
