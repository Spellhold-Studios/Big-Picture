@0    = ~So.  You must be the Bhaalspawn Melissan told me of.  I have been expecting you.~ [BALTHA07]
@1    = ~How do you know who I am?~
@2    = ~Where is Melissan?  I need to speak with her.~
@3    = ~Yes, I am <PRO_HESHE>.~
@4    = ~I am Balthazar, head of the monastic order here in Amkethran and its ruler, as well, although that is not an official position.  Melissan preceded you and told me of your coming.~ [BALTHA08]
@5    = ~Melissan has already left the village, and did not say where she was going.  She has left with me directions for you to reach these...enclaves...she mentioned.  Is this what you expected?~ [BALTHA09]
@6    = ~No.  She said she would meet me here.~
@7    = ~She mentioned you...I appreciate your help.~
@8    = ~How can I trust you to give me proper information?  I know nothing about you.~
@9    = ~And I know little enough of you, Bhaalspawn.  Melissan has vouched for you, however, so I'll tolerate your presence and give you what you need.~
@10   = ~I do not know where Melissan may have gone, nor do I care.  As for you, Melissan has vouched for you...I'll tolerate your presence, for now, and give you what you need.~
@11   = ~Melissan has vouched for you, <CHARNAME>.  As far as that goes, I will tolerate your presence and give you the information that Melissan asked me to.~
@12   = ~Here are the maps to the enclaves Melissan mentioned.  Neither of them are very far from here, as you can see...add them to your own map, if you wish.~
@13   = ~Do with them as you wish, <CHARNAME>.  Amkethran is available for your supplies and rest...do not disturb my own activities and we'll not come to grief, is that understood?~
@14   = ~What sort of activities are you talking about?~
@15   = ~I was expecting someone a little...friendlier.~
@16   = ~Do not threaten me, Balthazar.~
@17   = ~Fair enough...it's your town, after all.~
@18   = ~That's none of your business.  You'll not be allowed into my fortress...anywhere else is open to you.  Good day and good luck to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@19   = ~Meeting with Balthazar

I have finally met with Balthazar, the head of the monastic order in Amkethran, and while he was not exactly welcoming he did allow me to remain in the town so long as I did not attempt to enter the monastery or otherwise interfere in his business...and passed on to me the maps to the Bhaalspawn enclaves that Melissan presumably gave him.

Where Melissan is, now, appears to be a mystery.  I am not entirely certain that this Balthazar is on the level.  Regardless, there is no reason for me to try to get inside his fortress-like monastery and no way that I can see of doing so.  My only path is to investigate the enclaves and confront the Bhaalspawn who are so intent on hunting me.~
@20   = ~Considering what happened to Saradush, be thankful you find welcome anywhere.  You may not enter my fortress while you are here, <CHARNAME>. Elsewhere is open to you.  Good luck.~
@21   = ~It is not a threat, it is a warning.  My own fortress, here, is off limits to you.  Everywhere else in Amkethran you may enter.  Good day and good luck, <CHARNAME>.~
@22   = ~Thank you.  Do not enter my fortress, <CHARNAME>...you will be denied entry.  Everywhere else is open to you.  Good day and good luck.~
@23   = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>... your presence here shows me how foolish I have been in gathering my army of mercenaries.  I truly regret my wasted efforts at the expense of Amkethran's citizens.~ [BALTHA10]
@24   = ~I demand to know where Melissan is!~
@25   = ~I know your secret, Balthazar.  You were working with Abazigal and Sendai!~
@26   = ~I am the child of a God!  Did you really think your pathetic army could stop me?~
@27   = ~I assure you, the Lady Melissan is not here.  We had a... disagreement from which she hastily departed.  I shall deal with her once my business with you is finished.~
@28   = ~Save your lies!  I know you were working with Abazigal and Sendai.~
@29   = ~No, in truth I had other plans for my army.  But since you killed Abazigal and Sendai, I have no further need of these mercenaries who so drain the monastery's treasury.  ~
@30   = ~Spare me your lies... I know you were working with Abazigal and Sendai.~
@31   = ~I suppose it may have appeared as such, though in truth I have plotted their destruction ever since Melissan recruited me into the Five.~
@32   = ~What kind of lies are you spinning now?~
@33   = ~Are you saying Melissan is the leader of the Five?~
@34   = ~Are you trying to tell me that you are one of the Five?  A Bhaalspawn?~
@35   = ~Look beyond the surface, <CHARNAME>.  The truth lies buried deep - as it often does when dealing with those of Bhaal's treacherous blood.~
@36   = ~Melissan recognized the taint of Bhaal within me, just as she recognized it in Sendai, Abazigal and the others.  Just as she recognized it in you.~ [BALTHA11]
@37   = ~She lured me with promises of power and glory, but I followed her for a different reason.  Only by joining the Five could I discover who the others were - and plot their demise.~ [BALTHA12]
@38   = ~So you used me to betray the other Bhaalspawn for your own goals.~
@39   = ~I guess by killing your "allies" I have done your dirty work for you.~
@40   = ~You mean you manipulated me, used me as a tool against the other Bhaalspawn.~
@41   = ~I wish I could take the credit for this ruse, <CHARNAME>.  But it seems I was not the only member of the Five who plotted the downfall of the others.~
@42   = ~Melissan is the puppet master pulling your strings in this staged production.  I have merely tried to stay out of your path for as long as possible, anxious to see if you would prevail.~ [BALTHA13]
@43   = ~This is all just an elaborate lie - I don't believe you!~
@44   = ~Why would Melissan have gathered the Five only to plot their destruction?~
@45   = ~It matters not, <CHARNAME>.  In the end both Melissan and I have what we want: the other members of the Five are dead, though she and I remain at odds.~
@46   = ~And now I suppose you plan to kill me so you can resurrect Bhaal all by yourself?~
@47   = ~Oh no, <CHARNAME>.  I have no such designs.  Bhaal's taint is an evil blight upon the world.  I have no intention of bringing the Lord of Murder back into existence.~
@48   = ~My plan is much more altruistic.  I have vowed to exterminate all of Bhaal's children, forever wiping the Realms clean of his tainted existence.  You have merely helped me in my goal.~
@49   = ~But you are a Child of Bhaal as well - what happens to you?~
@50   = ~Once I am certain I am the last, once I know there are no others, I will perform a ritual suicide.  Bhaal's evil will die with me.  But first, I must end your evil existence.~ [BALTHA14]
@51   = ~But I am not evil!  I am a force of good and justice!~
@52   = ~You sound like a hypocrite to me, sentencing those you have no right to judge!~
@53   = ~You won't be the first to try and kill me...and probably not the last!~
@54   = ~How noble.  I'll enjoy spilling your pretentious guts all over the floor.~
@55   = ~Further conversation is pointless, <CHARNAME>.  I have a task which I must complete.  Your death is a necessity, Bhaalspawn.~ [BALTHA17]
@56   = ~Assault on the Enclaves

Balthazar revealed himself as a Bhaalspawn, and one of the Five - though he never shared their goal of resurrecting Bhaal.  The mad monk wanted to wipe the taint of Bhaal from the world by killing all of Bhaal's children, including himself.
More disturbing were the implications he leveled at the still absent Melissan.  If his words are true, she has been manipulating me the entire time for her own nefarious purposes.~
@57   = ~People sing the praises of your name, <CHARNAME>.  You strive to walk the path of virtue.  But your intentions are meaningless compared to the consequences of your existence.  ~
@58   = ~Your lies are not surprising.  You infamy preceeds you, <CHARNAME>.  All know you are a scourge upon the earth... your name is whispered with fear and dread.~
@59   = ~How many bodies have you left in your wake?  Hundreds?  Thousands?  Saradush is a smoking waste... how many other cities and towns have you brought destruction raining down upon?~ [BALTHA15]
@60   = ~But it wasn't my fault!  I'm a victim of circumstance!~
@61   = ~I can explain everything, if you give me a chance.~
@62   = ~And how many corpses have you left behind, Balthazar?~
@63   = ~I bring destruction wherever I go, and I revel in the blood!  I am death incarnate!~
@64   = ~I am much the same, <CHARNAME>.  Our mere presence brings death... it is inevitable.  It is our destiny.  We are not to blame, we are slaves to our father's tainted blood.~
@65   = ~And as your power grows, <CHARNAME>, so shall the ruin sown in your passing.  Kingdoms will fall, and the rivers of Faerun will run with blood.  ~ [BALTHA16]
@66   = ~No, I do not accept this destiny you are laying on me!~
@67   = ~You condemn me based on my possible future?  That is not justice.~
@68   = ~I like the sound of that!~
@69   = ~It is true.  You are a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>, and your stance against evil is without question.  Your fight against the taint of our evil father is worthy of praise.~
@70   = ~I sense no innate goodness within you, <CHARNAME>...though your deeds are hailed far and wide as above reproach.  It is...interesting that one like you who must struggle so much with our father's taint inside <PRO_HIMHER> has done so much to fight true evil.~
@71   = ~I see the good that is within you, <CHARNAME>, but your deeds are hardly above reproach.  I sense only a soul that struggles with our father's taint, that struggles to find the good path where none exists.~
@72   = ~I sense no innate goodness within you, <CHARNAME>.  I do not think your deeds above reproach.  I sense only a soul struggling against the taint of <PRO_HISHER> father, much like mine own.~
@73   = ~Actually, I am the perfect person to judge, <CHARNAME>.  I, too, contain the taint of our father within me.  I, too, have felt its yearnings for blood, its efforts to exert chaos upon my life.  I have mastered it...but only barely.  Too well I know what it is capable of.~
@74   = ~Naturally.  Our taint brings us no peace, does it, <CHARNAME>?  We fight in self-defense and yet still we kill, still we bring destruction.  We may claim an absence of responsibility, should we desire, but I know all too well what the taint in our soul is capable of.  Only barely do I keep it mastered.~
@75   = ~I would expect no other response from a true <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> of mine.  I know too well the thirst for death that comes with the taint of our sire.  I have mastered it, but only barely...I pity those who are a slave to it.~
@76   = ~Do not make me laugh, <CHARNAME>.  If you expect me to believe that your depraved existence exists to fight against evil in this world, then you expect far too much.~
@77   = ~But regardless of our wishes on the matter, our destiny has been written for us, <CHARNAME>.  Some may run from it or deny it, while others embrace it...but each and every Bhaalspawn has a seed within them that has sprung forth a fruit laden with blood and murder.  Do you deny this?~
@78   = ~Are you implying that you are somehow different, Balthazar?~
@79   = ~I have only ever acted when it was necessary, in self-defense.~
@80   = ~You would make us out to be victims of circumstance rather than masters of our own destiny.~
@81   = ~I deny nothing.  Death comes for all who stand in my way.~
@82   = ~I am death incarnate, fool!  Not some weak fool wrapped in denial like yourself!~
@83   = ~I have little doubt that you know whereof I speak.  The taint is strong within you...stronger than any single other spawn of our sire that I have seen.  You have felt the dreams, the urges, have you not?  The chaos that is your destiny has ripped wantonly through your life, regardless of your wishes, has it not?  Do you deny that you bring violence and destruction wherever you go, <CHARNAME>?~
@84   = ~I am nothing like you.  I exist to fight against the chaos of my taint, to fight against the evil that Bhaal's legacy brings to this world.  I have faced the evil within me and I have mastered it.~
@85   = ~No.  I have brought my share of death and destruction to this land.  But I see a larger purpose behind it...I seek to end the possibility of Bhaal's return forever, and to wipe his taint from the land.~
@86   = ~I have mastered the power within me and held the evil in check, but I know as well...if not better...then most of my brethren the threat that it holds for all of Faerun.  I will not allow this.  I have dedicated my life to preventing it.~
@87   = ~If only we had met under other circumstances, <CHARNAME>...I would have liked to sit and compare the paths that have brought us to this point.  If we had not been forced by destiny to bear this taint upon our souls, what would have become of us?  I regret what I must do, yet I know it must be done.~
@88   = ~And what becomes of Melissan, then?  Is she free to raise Bhaal and complete her plans?~
@89   = ~You don't have to do this, Balthazar.  We don't have to fight each other.~
@90   = ~You don't honestly see yourself as the force of righteousness in all this, do you?~
@91   = ~Enough talk, then.  Let's get this over with.~
@92   = ~Of course not.  It is she that holds the key to Bhaal's resurrection.  After you are dead, she too must be destroyed.~
@93   = ~Then we should fight her together!  How do you know she still can't summon Bhaal...everything you've fought for will be for nothing!~
@94   = ~And you're going to stop her alone?  Have you given any thought to the fact that maybe you've been helping her all along, that she's been playing you like a harp?~
@95   = ~Yet another death added to your tally?  And what then, once you kill her?  Once you have all that power and it's yours alone...you think you're going to resist that?~
@96   = ~What makes you think you could kill her?  I'm the one that has defeated all the Bhaalspawn...while you were doing nothing but hiding in this fortress making the peasants miserable.~
@97   = ~I thought you were going to kill yourself after I was dead.  Sure you won't see some more evil once Melissan is dead, too?  You'd probably make a promising Lord of Murder, you know...~
@98   = ~Forget it.  This is pointless.  Let's just get this over with.~
@99   = ~Fight her together?~
@100  = ~No.  How could I trust you?  What if we were to vanquish Melissan, I would be weakened...you could end my life there and everything I have been working towards will be for nothing.~
@101  = ~...I...~
@102  = ~I had thought when this moment arrived, I would hold clearly to my purpose.  We must...end this, <CHARNAME>.  I wish this to be over with, one way or the other.~
@103  = ~Alright, Balthazar.  If that's what you want...let's end this now.~
@104  = ~I am at a loss, <CHARNAME>.  You question me, and I have no good answers for you.  My heart tells me that you must be killed, but I am not sure if I should listen to it.  What...what would you have me do?~
@105  = ~Join me, Balthazar.  Let us fight Melissan together, instead of doing what she wants us to.~
@106  = ~I don't know, Balthazar.  But I don't want to fight you.~
@107  = ~Let us fight, then, if it must be.  Let me give you some peace at last.~
@108  = ~You're a weaker fool then I thought.  Let's just end this now, shall we?  I have an appointment with god-hood.~
@109  = ~Yes...you are right.~
@110  = ~Very well, then, <CHARNAME>.  I will join you.  You are a worthy <PRO_MANWOMAN>.  Perhaps even worthy of turning Bhaal's dark taint and making something better of it.  I do not know.  But I will take that chance.~
@111  = ~Let Melissan tremble when she sees us together, and we shall strike her down as she deserves.  Even if Bhaal himself is resurrected, he will not be able to hold out against us both.  I have preparations to make, <CHARNAME>.  Go to the Throne of Bhaal.  When the time comes, I will be there.~
@112  = ~I cannot, <CHARNAME>.~
@113  = ~You must take the battle to Melissan.  It is your destiny to see that the Bhaal's legacy ends here and now.  But you must promise me, <CHARNAME>...you must promise me that you will not give into the temptation.  Should you defeat Melissan and the power become available to you, you must turn away from it...you have seen your struggle as it is now, with only a sliver of that taint.  Do not take it, <CHARNAME>...even a god can be tempted, you must realize that.  Promise me you will turn it away.~
@114  = ~If I am given the option, Balthazar...I will refuse the taint.  I swear it.~
@115  = ~No.  I will swear nothing of the kind.  Great good could come out of that power, you don't know otherwise any better than I.~
@116  = ~Forget it!  I'll do no such thing!~
@117  = ~Then I am satisfied.  The essence of our sire ends with me...and with you.  May the gods forgive me.  May you...may you forgive me, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>...~
@118  = ~Then we must do battle.  I...I am sorry, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>.  I had hoped this would be otherwise.~
@119  = ~And I cannot trust that you will turn aside the power when it is offered to you.  You have experienced the struggle even a sliver of Bhaal's taint has brought you, yet I cannot believe that you would turn it aside.  I...I am sorry, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>...but I have no choice.~
@120  = ~So be it.  Come, my pupils...may the gods help us all.~
@121  = ~No.  Further dialogue is pointless.  Let us end this now, <CHARNAME>...and may the gods have pity on us all.~
@122  = ~Perhaps what you are saying holds merit.  But what if I died during the battle?  What if I was weakened, in the end...you might find yourself...tempted.  How could I trust you?~
@123  = ~What do you mean?~
@124  = ~I don't know how to explain it, exactly, but she must have used you!  She used everyone else!  I didn't trust her and she even got me to do what she wanted!~
@125  = ~Think about it, Balthazar!  You honestly think she didn't know what your plans were?  Do you think you took her by surprise?  Even I saw it coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it!~
@126  = ~She used you to get rid of the other Bhaalspawn, obviously.  Think about it!  She knew what you were planning all along.  She wanted all the Bhaalspawn dead...and she wants us to fight!  She *wants* this to happen!!~
@127  = ~Of course she used me, <CHARNAME>.  And no doubt she knew my plans as well as I knew hers.  This changes nothing.~
@128  = ~You...may be right, <CHARNAME>.  But that does not mean that my plan will fail.  Melissan underestimates me, I am sure of that...just as she underestimates you.~
@129  = ~I...perhaps you are right, <CHARNAME>.  I see the wisdom of your words.  Still...this does not mean my plan is doomed to failure.  Or is it?~
@130  = ~I must resist it.  I will.  I have no choice.~
@131  = ~But...you have shown great willpower, as well.  Despite the taint in your soul, you have struggled against it just as I have.  What makes me more worthy...?  No, I must not question myself!  Not now!~
@132  = ~You are certainly no better a candidate for resisting such temptation, <CHARNAME>.  I would trust myself far more than I would trust you.  To send you to the Throne would be to give up everything I have believed in.~
@133  = ~Strength is nothing, <CHARNAME>.  You may vanquish me with your might, and you may even vanquish Melissan.  But you will never vanquish yourself.  Might will bring you no peace...this I know.  And this is why I must be the last.~
@134  = ~I am tired of the battles I have fought, <CHARNAME>.  I am tired of the anguish that I have endured, placing the greater good above the welfare of others, of myself and my own immortal soul.  It will be enough that Bhaal's legacy is destroyed, there is no temptation beyond that.~
@135  = ~But I do.  It is my destiny.  What other choice have I?~
@136  = ~You always have a choice, Balthazar.  Don't be a slave to Alaundo's prophecy!  I have fought against it ever since I found out about my heritage and I will *not* give up!~
@137  = ~Alaundo's prophecy does not mean the Bhaalspawn must be destroyers, Balthazar!  It also means we can stop the prophecy from becoming true, I know this!~
@138  = ~You can walk away.  You can do what's right, Balthazar, what you know to be right instead of what you've resigned yourself to.~
@139  = ~You are walking a path that you don't need to, Balthazar.  You see yourself as evil, but it doesn't have to be that way.~
@140  = ~I am your <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, Balthazar.  Let us fight what is inevitable!  We can work together!~
@141  = ~Forget it.  There's no point in discussing this with you, is there?  Let's get this over with.~
@142  = ~You are impressive with your words, <CHARNAME>.  I can feel destiny altering to your will, how you are the center of it all...how is it that I did not see this before?~
@143  = ~But the simple truth is your words ring hollow to me.  I do not believe them.  You have fought against destiny, yet I see it in you even the more as you speak.~
@144  = ~Perhaps...perhaps there is something to your words.  I look within myself and see how rigidly I have held myself to my destiny...and I feel hollow.  But I...cannot believe that this has been for nothing.~
@145  = ~What do you mean?  How do you know this?~
@146  = ~It was told to me by a Solar, an agent of prophecy!  It...oh, I know how it sounds, but it's true!~
@147  = ~I have been told many things by agents of Alaundo's prophecy...higher beings that have sought me out to prepare me.  Alaundo's prophecy does not necessarily mean what you think it does, Balthazar.~
@148  = ~A Solar has been my mentor since this began, guiding me and preparing me for what is to come.  The prophecy is not so simple as you think it to be, no matter how we assume it to be.  Think about it and you'll know it to be true, Balthazar...everything has more than one side.~
@149  = ~I have no agent of the heavens to interpret my destiny for me, <CHARNAME>.  And my path remains clear.~
@150  = ~You plant a seed of doubt in me, <CHARNAME>, and I begin to wonder.  Yet...it seems that my destiny may differ from yours.  I have no heavenly guidance.  Perhaps my path has been made for me, yet.~
@151  = ~What you say is incredible, and yet...it does make sense.  Have I prepared myself for all this time in error?  How could this be?~
@152  = ~An appealing notion, to walk away.  Would that I could do so.  Would that any of us could have done so.~
@153  = ~But perhaps I have resigned myself to a path that is not what it seems.  You are...hardly what I expected for the last of the Bhaalspawn, <CHARNAME>.  Perhaps there is hope...or perhaps I am only deluding myself.~
@154  = ~But that is a fool's notion, <CHARNAME>, and I am no fool.  There is no such option available to me or any of us, no matter how appealing you may make it seem.~
@155  = ~No!  You have listened to nothing I have said!  It *is* that way because there is no choice for us!  You would have me forget all the murders I have committed with my own hands, all the wrongs I have done in the name of the greater good...I cannot forget!  I will not forgive myself and I will *not* allow others to be afflicted with the taint I possess!~
@156  = ~You have considerable charisma, <CHARNAME>...but it is because we are siblings that we cannot work together.  You know as well as I what the essence seeks, and it will not be satisfied until our destiny is culminated.~
@157  = ~I make no judgement upon you, <CHARNAME>.  You are what you were born to be.  I can only trust myself to hold to the path of good that will lead to the destruction of the true evil that threatens Faerun.  There is no other path for me.~
@158  = ~Look at the suffering you have brought to Amkethran!  Your monks terrorize the innocent at your command!  You hire soulless mercenaries that cut down the innocent at the slightest provocation!  And all for nothing!  You call these the actions of a good man?~
@159  = ~A truly good man would have stood against Melissan from the beginning.  You say you wanted to find out who the Five were...and yet I defeated them without your scheming.  It was your choice to join the Five in their reign of destruction, so live up to it!~
@160  = ~You make no judgement upon me?  Don't make me laugh!  Inevitability is only the newest excuse for yet one more murder!  You would make our father proud!~
@161  = ~And what if that is my path, too, Balthazar?  You say you don't judge me, and yet you hold yourself to some duty as the only person who can fight against evil?  Do you know destiny so well that you can say for certain where it leads for someone else, never mind yourself?~
@162  = ~Then let's get this over with.  I'm tired of talking.~
@163  = ~It...it is true.  I paid little attention to my men's actions, but I...I knew what they were doing.  I thought it a great sacridice, necessary to maintain secrecy, to attain my ultimate goal that they, in their ignorance, did not know would benefit them more in the end.  But...it is how we treat the most helpless of our brethren in the worst of times that marks the goodness of a man, does it not?  I...I am ashamed, <CHARNAME>.  I sought...only to do what was best for us all.~
@164  = ~You found out who the Five were through Melissan's scheming...and through, in no small part, my own.  But who is to say that things might not have been different?  Who are *you* to say that things might have been different?~
@165  = ~But...it is true, nevertheless.  I have taken the easy path, and have done much that has brought harm to others in the name of necessity.  But when does 'necessity' cross into the realm of evil?  I...I am ashamed, <CHARNAME>.~
@166  = ~I do not stand here proud of my accomplishments in attaining what I see to be a necessary goal...but neither should you.  You have blundered about, causing more harm by your negligence than I ever could by my plotting.~
@167  = ~I will *not* be mocked so!  I have sacrificed my entire life, the people of this village, everything I have in order to see this evil destroyed!  Destroyed, all of it!  I cry out to Ao the Overfather that such evil must not be allowed to live in the hearts of mortals, and I *will* be heard!~
@168  = ~I...know only what the temptations are that the taints puts upon us, <CHARNAME>.  I know only that if our power was to grow, if your power was to grow, that so would the temptation.~
@169  = ~But...you have been successful in fighting temptation.  More successful than I.  I have...done much that I regret, in the name of good.  My people suffer because I held my ultimate goal above all else...but is it not true that our treatment of the least of our brethren is the true judge of a man's soul?  I...I am ashamed.~
@170  = ~And despite what you might profess, I think the taint sits closer to your heart then you would have me believe.  I must walk my own path, <CHARNAME>...and you must walk yours.~
@171  = ~Very well.  Come, my students...my teachings are ended.  We make our last stand now for what is right.  May the gods have pity on us all.~
@172  = ~Even had destiny not brought us to this point, I doubt things would have been different.  Perhaps if you had not borne the taint of our sire, things might have been different with you.  I would have liked to meet a <PRO_MANWOMAN> such as yourself without the taint on your soul, I think.  But now I have little choice.~
@173  = ~Would that your claim of innocence meant anything to the dead of Saradush.  Were I to question the recent dead of Athkatla, of Baldur's Gate, of Candlekeep...would I not find some who would claim such innocence for themselves?  Who died merely because they were caught in your wake?~
@174  = ~Do you think that others of our kind are any different?  Count them, <CHARNAME>, and think of the multitudes of Bhaalspawn that existed and brought misery to others, if not by intent, then even by their very presence.  Would you allow such carnage to continue?  Have we not spared the entire land from agony by the slaying of our siblings?~
@175  = ~You believe yourself to be the master of your destiny, do you?  The destiny foreseen long ago by Alaundo?  You believe it by choice alone that you ended up here, in this place?~
@176  = ~You mistake the path for the journey, my friend.  Whatever paths you have taken since leaving Candlekeep, the journey has ended here as it was always meant to.  Destiny masters us...we do not master it.~
@177  = ~Yes, whether they were obstacles to be overcome or merely by-standers crossing your path.  My own life has been little different, no matter how I have struggled against it.  I am glad you see this...it will make things much easier.~
@178  = ~You sound like Yaga-Shura, a giant in ego as well as body.  Yet he fell, too, when his fate came due.  The power of your blood may yet make you victorious, it is true, but the fact that you embrace the taint within you makes my own path that much the clearer.~
